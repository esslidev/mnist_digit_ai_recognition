# MNIST Digit Recognition from Scratch with NumPy

Welcome to the MNIST Digit Recognition project repository! In this project, we will build a neural network model from scratch using NumPy to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement a neural network model from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Train the model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning.
- Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a test dataset and measure its accuracy.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy
- Development Tools: Vs code, Git

## Usage

To get started with the project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy).
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook files to build, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different model architectures, and tweak hyperparameters to improve performance!

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:
- Neural network architecture and implementation.
- Forward propagation, backward propagation (backpropagation), and gradient descent optimization.
- Activation functions, loss functions, and evaluation metrics.
- Training and testing neural network models from scratch using NumPy.

## Feedback and Contributions

Feedback and contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, ideas, or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy learning and coding!
